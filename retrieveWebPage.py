# You are to retrieve the following document using the HTTP
# protocol in a way that you can examine the HTTP Response
# headers.
#
# http://data.pr4e.org/intro-short.txt
#
# There are three ways that you might retrieve this web page
# and look at the response headers:
#
# 1. Preferred: Modify the socket1.py program to retrieve the
# above URL and print out the headers and data. Make sure
# to change the code to retrieve the above URL - the values
# are different for each URL.
#
# 2. Open the URL in a web browser with a developer console
# or FireBug and manually examine the headers that are returned.
#
# 3. Use the telnet program as shown in lecture to retrieve
# the headers and content.
